# Tetris game

this is a simple tetris game made with javascript

i`m currently working on an api [tetris-api](https://github.com/matheusWegner/tetris-api/)  to make a tetris battle royale , just like we have on [www.tetr](https://tetr.io/).

## Structure
```shell
tetris
├── tetris.js
└── tetris.html
```
open the tetris.html file in you browse to see how the game works
